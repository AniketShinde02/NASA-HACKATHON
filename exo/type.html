<h1>Types of Exoplanets</h1>

<div class="exoplanet">
    <h2>Gas Giant</h2>
    <p>Gas giants are large planets composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. They lack a well-defined solid surface and are characterized by their massive size and thick atmospheres. Their identification often involves observing the gravitational effects they exert on nearby stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="exoplanet">
    <h2>Neptunian</h2>
    <p>Neptunian planets are similar to Neptune in our solar system, featuring a thick atmosphere with a significant amount of water, ammonia, and methane. These planets are typically smaller than gas giants but larger than terrestrial planets, making them easier to identify through methods like transit photometry.</p>
</div>

<div class="exoplanet">
    <h2>Super-Earth</h2>
    <p>Super-Earths are rocky planets larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants. They may have conditions that allow for liquid water and potentially life. Their identification often relies on measuring their mass and radius through the radial velocity method or transit method.</p>
</div>

<div class="exoplanet">
    <h2>Terrestrial</h2>
    <p>Terrestrial planets are rocky worlds similar to Earth, with solid surfaces and potential atmospheres. They are identified by their size and composition, often using techniques like transit spectroscopy to analyze their atmospheres for signs of habitability.</p>
